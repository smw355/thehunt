Basic informational clues that direct teams to locations or give instructions.
```json
{
  "type": "route-info",
  "title": "Find the Red Bridge",
  "content": [
    "Make your way to the historic red bridge in downtown.",
    "Once there, find the plaque with the founding date.",
    "Take a photo of your team with the plaque clearly visible."
  ],
  "requiredPhotos": 1
}
```

#### 2. **Detour**
Teams choose between two different tasks (just like the TV show).
```json
{
  "type": "detour",
  "title": "Work It or Walk It",
  "detourOptionA": {
    "title": "Work It",

  "clues": [
    {
      "type": "route-info",

      "requiredPhotos": 1
    },
    {
      "type": "detour",
      "title": "Fast Food or Slow Food",
      "detourOptionA": {
        "title": "Fast Food",
        "description": "Visit any fast food restaurant and order exactly 3 different items. Take photos of each item and your receipt showing the timestamp."
      },
      "detourOptionB": {
        "title": "Slow Food",

      ],
      "requiredPhotos": 1
    }

### üì∏ **Multi-Photo Challenge System**

#### NEW: Required Photos Feature
Set `requiredPhotos` to any number from `0-10` for precise photo requirements:

- **`requiredPhotos: 0`**: Optional photos (teams can submit text or photos)
- **`requiredPhotos: 1-10`**: Exact number of photos required (enforced validation)

#### Mobile Photo Experience
Teams get dual upload options on mobile devices:
- **üîµ Blue Button**: "Take Photo" - Opens camera for new photos
- **üü¢ Green Button**: "Select from Gallery" - Choose existing photos

#### Real-Time Feedback System
- **Photo Counter**: Shows "(2/5 required photos)" progress
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - üî¥ Red: Need more photos
  - üü° Yellow: Too many photos
  - üü¢ Green: Perfect count
- **Smart Validation**: Prevents submission unless exact count met

### üìã **Quick Reference: Required Photos Field**

| Value | Behavior | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `requiredPhotos: 0` | Optional photos (default) | Text-based challenges, flexible submission |
| `requiredPhotos: 1` | Exactly 1 photo required | Simple photo tasks, team selfies |
| `requiredPhotos: 2-5` | Multiple specific photos | Multi-step challenges, before/after shots |
| `requiredPhotos: 6-10` | High-count photo collections | Scavenger hunts, artifact collections |

### üí° **Clue Writing Best Practices**

#### Route Info Clues
- **Be Specific**: Include landmark details and clear directions
- **Photo Requirements**: Use `requiredPhotos` field for exact counts needed
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Start easy, increase complexity throughout race
- **Local Knowledge**: Reference well-known local landmarks

#### Detour Clues
- **Balanced Options**: Make sure both choices take similar time/effort
- **Clear Differences**: Options should feel distinctly different (physical vs mental)
- **Equipment Needs**: Consider what teams will have available
- **Location Variety**: Mix indoor/outdoor and different neighborhoods

#### Roadblock Clues
- **Cryptic Questions**: Don't give away the task (like TV show)
- **Single Person**: Task must be completable by one team member
- **Clear Success Criteria**: Teams must know when they're done
- **Photo/Video Proof**: Specify exactly what evidence is needed
