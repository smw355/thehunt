## üìã **Clue Creation & Management**

### Challenge Types

#### 1. **Route Info**
Basic informational clues that direct teams to locations or give instructions.
```json
{
  "type": "route-info",
  "title": "Find the Red Bridge",
  "content": [
    "Make your way to the historic red bridge in downtown.",
    "Once there, find the plaque with the founding date.",
    "Take a photo of your team with the plaque clearly visible."
  ]
}
```

#### 2. **Detour**
Teams choose between two different tasks (just like the TV show).
```json
{
  "type": "detour",
  "title": "Work It or Walk It",
  "detourOptionA": {
    "title": "Work It",
    "description": "Find a local coffee shop and successfully make and serve a cappuccino to a customer. Take a photo of the finished drink and the happy customer."
  },
  "detourOptionB": {
    "title": "Walk It",
    "description": "Walk to the nearest park and find 5 different types of flowers. Take individual photos of each flower type with a team member's hand for scale."
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Roadblock**
One team member must be selected before the task is revealed.
```json
{
  "type": "road-block",
  "title": "Memory Challenge",
  "roadblockQuestion": "Who has the best memory for details?",
  "roadblockTask": "Study the storefront window display for 2 minutes, then recreate the exact arrangement using items from your backpack. Take a photo of your recreation next to the original."
}
```

### üì§ **Importing Clue Libraries**

#### Creating Your JSON File

Create a file called `my-clues.json` with this structure:

```json

  "clues": [
    {
      "type": "route-info",

        "Begin your race at Central Station's main entrance.",
        "Look for the information board with departure times.",
        "Take a team photo in front of the board showing the current time."
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "detour",
      "title": "Fast Food or Slow Food",
      "detourOptionA": {
        "title": "Fast Food",
        "description": "Visit any fast food restaurant and order exactly 3 different items. Take photos of each item and your receipt showing the timestamp."
      },
      "detourOptionB": {
        "title": "Slow Food",
        "description": "Find a sit-down restaurant and order an appetizer. Take a photo with the server and a selfie with your food when it arrives."
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "road-block",
      "title": "Street Performance",
      "roadblockQuestion": "Who's ready to entertain the crowd?",
      "roadblockTask": "Perform a 2-minute street performance (song, dance, or comedy) and collect at least $5 in donations. Take a photo of the money collected and a video of the performance."
    },
    {
      "type": "route-info",
      "title": "City Hall Finish",
      "content": [
        "Make your way to City Hall for the finish line.",

### üí° **Clue Writing Best Practices**

#### Route Info Clues
- **Be Specific**: Include landmark details and clear directions
- **Photo Requirements**: Always specify what should be in the photo
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Start easy, increase complexity throughout race
- **Local Knowledge**: Reference well-known local landmarks

#### Detour Clues
- **Balanced Options**: Make sure both choices take similar time/effort
- **Clear Differences**: Options should feel distinctly different (physical vs mental)
- **Equipment Needs**: Consider what teams will have available
- **Location Variety**: Mix indoor/outdoor and different neighborhoods

#### Roadblock Clues
- **Cryptic Questions**: Don't give away the task (like TV show)
- **Single Person**: Task must be completable by one team member
- **Clear Success Criteria**: Teams must know when they're done
- **Photo/Video Proof**: Specify exactly what evidence is needed
