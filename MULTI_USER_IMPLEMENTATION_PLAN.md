## üèóÔ∏è Multi-User Architecture Design

### **Key Differences from Legacy**

#### Legacy (Current `/legacy`)
```
Single admin password ‚Üí controls everything
Teams login with game code + credentials
No user accounts
No persistence across games
Clue library is global/shared
```

#### Multi-User (Target Architecture)
```
OAuth user accounts (GitHub, Google)
User owns/creates games
User invites others as co-game-masters or players
User has personal clue libraries
Games have access control (members only)
Users can be in multiple games with different roles
```

### **User Roles & Permissions**

#### 1. **Global Roles**
- `admin` - Platform administrator (can do anything)
- `user` - Standard user (can create games, libraries)

#### 2. **Game Roles** (per game via `gameMembers` table)
- `game_master` - Can manage game, review submissions, control teams
- `player` - Can join team, submit proofs, play game

#### 3. **Permission Matrix**
```
Action                        | game_master | player

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### **Approach: Parallel Modes**

Keep both modes running side-by-side:
1. **Legacy Mode** (`/legacy`) - Fully functional today
2. **Multi-User Mode** (new pages) - Rolled out progressively

### **Migration Path**

**Option A: Gradual (Recommended)**
```
1. Implement Phases 1-2 (Games + Libraries)
2. Enable for beta testers via feature flag
3. Gather feedback, iterate
4. Implement Phase 3 (Game Master)
5. Enable for more users
6. Implement Phase 4 (Player)
7. Full rollout
8. Keep legacy mode as "Quick Game" option
```

**Option B: Full Build**
```
1. Implement all phases (1-5)
2. Extensive testing
3. Single big launch
4. Deprecate legacy mode after 1 month
```

## üé® UI/UX Considerations

### **Consistent Design System**
- Continue using Tailwind CSS
- Maintain dark mode support
- Use existing color palette (primary, secondary, accent-green)
- Keep mobile-first responsive design
- Use Lucide icons consistently

### **Navigation Structure**
```
Dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ My Games
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Games I Created (game_master)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Games I'm Playing (player)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ My Libraries
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Personal Libraries
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Public Libraries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Invitations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pending Invites
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Send Invitation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Profile Settings

Individual Game
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Overview (stats, quick actions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Teams (for game_masters)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clues (sequence editor for game_masters)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Submissions (review for game_masters)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Play (for players)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Settings (invite, members, danger zone)
```

### **Responsive Breakpoints**
```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
sm: 640px   // Small tablets
md: 768px   // Tablets
lg: 1024px  // Small desktops
xl: 1280px  // Large desktops
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] Verify session on every API route
- [ ] Check game membership before showing data
- [ ] Verify role (game_master/player) for actions
- [ ] Use row-level security mindset
- [ ] Rate limit API endpoints
- [ ] Sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Validate file uploads (type, size)

### **Data Privacy**
- [ ] Users only see games they're members of
- [ ] Players only see own team data
- [ ] Game masters see all teams in their games
- [ ] Private libraries only visible to owner
- [ ] Public libraries visible to all authenticated users

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- [ ] API route handlers
- [ ] Database queries
- [ ] Form validation logic
- [ ] Permission checks

### **Integration Tests**
- [ ] Complete user flows:
  - [ ] Sign up ‚Üí create game ‚Üí invite player ‚Üí play ‚Üí complete
  - [ ] Create library ‚Üí add clues ‚Üí use in game
  - [ ] Submit proof ‚Üí review ‚Üí approve/reject

### **Manual Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Create account via GitHub OAuth
- [ ] Create personal clue library
- [ ] Add all 3 clue types
- [ ] Create game with library clues
- [ ] Invite another user as player
- [ ] Assign player to team
- [ ] Start game
- [ ] Submit proofs as player
- [ ] Review and approve/reject as game master
- [ ] Complete game as player
- [ ] Export/import clue libraries
- [ ] Delete game

---

## üìä Database Modifications Needed

### **Schema Updates**
```javascript
// Add createdBy to games table
export const games = pgTable('games', {
  // ... existing fields
  createdBy: integer('created_by').notNull().references(() => users.id),
});

// Add userId to clueLibraries (already exists ‚úì)
// Add userId to clues for ownership tracking
export const clues = pgTable('clues', {
  // ... existing fields
  userId: integer('user_id').references(() => users.id), // null = legacy clue
  libraryId: integer('library_id').references(() => clueLibraries.id),
});
```

### **Indexes to Add**
```sql
-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_game_members_user_id ON game_members(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_game_members_game_id ON game_members(game_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_clue_libraries_user_id ON clue_libraries(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_library_clues_library_id ON library_clues(library_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_status ON submissions(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_game_invitations_token ON game_invitations(invite_token);
```

- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Clue libraries
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2A: Admin can view/moderate all libraries**
- üîÑ Basic game master view (simplified Phase 3)
- üîÑ Basic player view (simplified Phase 4)

**Goal**: Users can create game, add clues, invite players, and complete one full game. Admins can monitor platform health and moderate content.

### **Sprint 2: Full Feature Parity (16-22 hours)**
Complete all legacy features in multi-user context:
- ‚úÖ Full game master dashboard (complete Phase 3)
- ‚úÖ Full player experience (complete Phase 4)
- ‚úÖ Submission review workflow
- ‚úÖ Team management

**Goal**: Feature parity with legacy app

### **Sprint 3: Multi-User Polish + Complete Admin (15-25 hours)**

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### **Architectural Decisions**

**1. Keep or Replace Legacy Mode?**
- **Recommendation**: Keep as "Quick Game" option
- **Reasoning**:
  - Valuable for demo/testing
  - Useful for users who want simple, no-login games
  - Can serve as backup if multi-user has issues

**2. Clue Ownership Model**
- **Decision**: Clues belong to libraries, libraries belong to users
- **Reasoning**: Allows for personal + public library ecosystem

**3. Team vs. Individual Players**
- **Decision**: Keep team-based model from legacy
- **Reasoning**: Core mechanic of the platform, changing would be major redesign

**4. Real-time Updates**
- **Decision**: Start with polling, add websockets later if needed
- **Reasoning**: Simpler to implement, good enough for most use cases

---

## üîÑ Migration from Legacy

### **For Existing Games**
```javascript
// Migration script needed:
// 1. Create default "legacy" user
// 2. Assign all existing games to this user as game_master
// 3. Create default "legacy" clue library
// 4. Move all existing clues to this library
// 5. Keep legacy URL working as-is
```

### **User Communication**

### **Phase 9: AI-Powered Self-Guided Mode** (Priority: FUTURE)
*Estimated: 20-30 hours*

#### Overview
Revolutionary feature that allows players to enjoy treasure hunts without a human game master. An AI agent acts as the game master, reviewing photo submissions, providing feedback, and adapting the experience in real-time using LLM technology.

#### Core Concept

**The Problem It Solves**
- Travelers want to experience curated treasure hunts but don't have a game master

};
```

#### Photo Verification Strategies

**Level 1: Computer Vision Only**
- [ ] Fast and cheap
- [ ] Object detection (e.g., "Does this contain a bridge?")
- [ ] Color analysis
- [ ] Scene classification
- [ ] Good for: Simple waypoint verification

**Level 2: LLM Image Analysis**
- [ ] More sophisticated understanding

**Verification Confidence Levels**
```javascript
// AI returns confidence score
{
  approved: true,
  confidence: 0.85, // 85% confident
  reasoning: "Photo clearly shows the red bridge with the team member visible in frame.",
  detected_objects: ["bridge", "person", "water"],
  missing_elements: [],
  suggestions: null
}
```

**Handling Edge Cases**
- [ ] Low confidence (50-70%):
  - [ ] Ask clarifying question
  - [ ] Request additional photo
  - [ ] Provide specific feedback
- [ ] Very low confidence (<50%):
  - [ ] Politely reject
  - [ ] Explain what's missing
  - [ ] Offer hint
- [ ] Multiple attempts (3+ rejections):
  - [ ] Offer to skip clue
  - [ ] Provide answer
  - [ ] Suggest easier difficulty

#### Hint System

**Hint Levels**
- [ ] **Level 1 - Subtle Nudge**:
  - [ ] Reframe the clue
  - [ ] Point to general area/direction
- [ ] **Level 2 - Clearer Direction**:
  - [ ] More specific location hints
  - [ ] What to look for
- [ ] **Level 3 - Almost There**:
  - [ ] Very specific instructions
  - [ ] Nearly gives it away

**Hint Delivery**
```javascript
// Player: "I need a hint"
// AI analyzes current context and provides appropriate hint

{
  hint_level: 1,
  message: "Think about famous landmarks near the city center. Look for something that tells time and can be seen from far away.",
  follow_up_enabled: true,
  estimated_distance: "200 meters", // if location tracking enabled
}
```

**Adaptive Hints**
- [ ] Time-based hints:
  - [ ] After 10 minutes ‚Üí offer hint level 1
  - [ ] After 20 minutes ‚Üí offer hint level 2
  - [ ] After 30 minutes ‚Üí offer skip option
- [ ] Attempt-based hints:
  - [ ] After 2 failed submissions ‚Üí offer hint
- [ ] Location-based hints (if GPS enabled):
  - [ ] "You're getting warmer/colder"
  - [ ] Distance to target

#### Safety & Content Moderation

**Photo Content Filtering**
- [ ] Automatic NSFW detection
- [ ] Inappropriate content flagging
- [ ] Privacy protection (faces, license plates)
- [ ] Immediate rejection of flagged content

**AI Response Moderation**
- [ ] Review AI outputs for appropriateness
- [ ] Filter harmful/offensive language
- [ ] Ensure family-friendly responses
- [ ] Log and review edge cases
